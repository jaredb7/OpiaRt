This project was inspired by translink-opiaproxy (https://github.com/wislon/translink-opiaproxy), who has done a awesome job of making the Translink OPIA API easy to use.

Checkout my version of his implmentionation: https://github.com/jaredb7/OpiaProxy

This is a CakePHP Plugin allowing easy access to the GTFS Real-Time feed offered by Translink
https://gtfsrt.api.translink.com.au/
Output of protobuf data is changable between JSON and PHPArray by specifing the argment ('json' or 'phparray') when initializing the GtfsRtLoader model.

I almost exclusively use the CakePHP framework when programming in PHP, so it made sense to make a plugin for it.

Hopefully this project speeds and helps projects for those developing on the Translink OPIA API :).
